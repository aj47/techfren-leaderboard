## üöÄ Features

- **Interactive Leaderboard**: Sort models by pass rate, speed, or cost
- **Detailed Model Information**: Click on any model to view comprehensive benchmark details
- **Matrix-inspired UI**: Featuring a digital rain animation background
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Real-time Data**: Displays the most recent benchmark results

## üìä About the Benchmarks

This leaderboard displays results from running the [Aider polyglot benchmarks](https://aider.chat/docs/leaderboards/) on various LLM models. The benchmarks test the models' ability to understand and modify code across multiple programming languages.

Key metrics include:
- **Pass Rate**: Percentage of test cases the model successfully completed
- **Speed**: Performance measured in milliseconds per test case (lower is better)
- **Cost**: Total cost to run the benchmark on the model
